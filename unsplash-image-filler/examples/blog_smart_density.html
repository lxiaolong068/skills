    <p>The morning air was crisp and salty as the train pulled into the coastal town.</p>
    <p>I walked along the harbor, watching fishermen mend nets and gulls circle overhead.</p>
    <p>The local market was already busy, with crates of citrus and baskets of herbs piled high.</p>
    <p>I stopped for coffee and listened to stories about storms that reshaped the shoreline.</p>
    <p>By noon, the light turned golden and the cliffs glowed above the beach.</p>
    <p>A narrow trail climbed through pines, revealing a stretch of hidden coves.</p>
    <p>Each cove felt quieter than the last, with only the sound of waves and wind.</p>
    <p>I paused to sketch the waterline and the scattered stones on the sand.</p>
    <p>Later, the town square filled with music and the scent of grilled seafood.</p>
    <p>A vendor shared a recipe passed down through three generations of cooks.</p>
    <p>Evening arrived quickly, and the harbor lights blinked on one by one.</p>
    <p>I ended the day on the pier, watching the horizon darken into deep blue.</p>
